            <h1>real beauty resides</h1>
            <h2>in imperfection</h2>
            <p>In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with something more human that will make us
                appreciate both the beauty and the imperfection of something made by hand.</p>

            <h2>the new black</h2>
            <p>This series of illustrations paradoxically combines absurdity and a deep sense of childishness and
                naivety.</p>

                take
                us?</p>
